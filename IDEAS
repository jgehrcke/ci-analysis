Build stability analysis with basic statistics:

Go to a percent scale and do a "proper" (well, basic) statistical analysis,
including the actual build rate. That is, say, 8 out of 10 builds passed. Then
show a data point at 80 %. But also show an error bar (or an error band) that
shows the statistical uncertainty: given 10 attempts and a derived mean -- what
is the standard error of the mean?
